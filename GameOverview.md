The Kraken Onslaught Arcade Shooter by @hellf17 (collaborations include @0xMonolith)

*Summary*

This game is originally written in the `arcade` library in Python. 
It was adapted to be run in PhaserJS, a Javascript game engine.

The player plays as the pseudo-kraken, owned by @hellf17, and later, any of their owned pseudo-kraken NFTs.

    +instructions to start, end, and restart the game, as well as controls
    +a start and a pause menu
    +an ending menu, displaying time survived, and XP earned
    +multiple enemies
    +multiple types of "buffs" and debuffs that the player can pick up
    +when the game ends, a screenshot of the game's last state is captured
    +the ending screenshot is displayed for the game over view
    +when player or enemy gets hitted or die they play a sound
